                Universal Studios Japan (ユニバーサル・スタジオ・ジャパン) is a
                theme park located in Osaka, Japan. Opened on March 31, 2001, it
                is one of six Universal Studios theme parks worldwide and was
                the first to open outside the United States. The park is owned
                and operated by USJ LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of
                NBCUniversal. The park is similar in layout to Universal Studios
                Florida and contains selected attractions from both Universal
                Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood, in addition to a small
                number of unique attractions.

              <h2>Mt.Fuji</h2>
              <p>
                Mount Fuji (富士山, Fujisan, Japanese: [ɸɯꜜ(d)ʑisaɴ]) is an
                active stratovolcano located on the Japanese island of Honshu,
                with a summit elevation of 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft 3 in). It is
                the highest mountain in Japan, the second-highest volcano
                located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the
                Indonesian island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an
                island on Earth. Mount Fuji last erupted from 1707 to 1708. The
                mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo and
                is visible from the Japanese capital on clear days. Mount Fuji's
                exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for
                about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural
                icon of Japan and is frequently depicted in art and photography,
                as well as visited by sightseers, hikers and mountain climbers.

                Dōtonbori or Dōtombori (道頓堀, pronounced [dotonboɾi]) is a
                district in Osaka, Japan. Known as one of Osaka's principal
                tourist and nightlife areas, the area runs along the Dōtonbori
                canal from Dōtonboribashi Bridge to Nipponbashi Bridge in the
                Namba district of the city's Chūō ward. Historically a theater
                district, it is now a popular nightlife and entertainment area
                characterized by its eccentric atmosphere and large illuminated
                signboards.
