        <img src="images/Luffy.jpeg" alt="Monkey.D.Luffy" />
        <p>
          Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of
          being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and
          mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the
          East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure,
          One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".

        <img src="images/Asta.jpeg" alt="Asta" />
        <p>
          A peasant orphan who was left at a church, he aspires to become the
          next Wizard King. He has no magical power, but overcame this through
          intense physical training which allow him to wield anti-magic swords
          from a five-leaf clover grimoire in which a devil resides. He then
          becomes a Magic Knight, joining the Black Bulls squad in hopes of
          achieving his dream.

        <p>
          Zoro is the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy to be part of his
          crew of pirates, after he is rescued by Luffy from execution. Zoro is
          a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew's combatant,[a]
          though he possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which recurs
          as a running gag throughout the series.

        <h2>Sanji</h2>

          Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand
          Fleet. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join,

          Yuno is promoted to vice-captain of the Golden Dawn, and eventually
          attains the rank of Grand Magic Knight, becoming the youngest to ever
          reach that rank. William Vangeance later renounces his position and
          appoints Yuno his successor as the squad's second captain.

          Usopp is the son of Yasopp and the late Banchina. He was born and
          raised in Syrup Village, serving as "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and
          being Kaya's close friend. After working with the Straw Hats to defeat
          Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was invited to join the crew.
          Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior
          of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of
          living up to this dream.
