      <li>Math</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" target="_blank"
          >Mathematics</a
        >
        is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and
        theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical
        sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics,
        which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study
        of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and
        spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes),
        and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics).

      <li>Sport</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport" target="_blank">Sport</a>
        is a form of physical activity or game. Often competitive and organized,
        sports use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills. They also
        provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to
        spectators. Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some
        are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. Most
        sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. Some
        sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner;
        others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of
        contests may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion.
        Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a
        regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

      <li>Science</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" target="_blank"
          >Science</a
        >
        a systematic discipline that builds and organises knowledge in the form
        of testable hypotheses and predictions about the universe. Modern
        science is typically divided into two or three major branches:the
        natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology), which study
        the physical world; and the behavioural sciences (e.g., economics,
        psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies. The
        formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer
        science), which study formal systems governed by axioms and rules, are
        sometimes described as being sciences as well; however, they are often
        regarded as a separate field because they rely on deductive reasoning
        instead of the scientific method or empirical evidence as their main
        methodology. Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific
        knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine.

      <li>History</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History" target="_blank"
          >History</a
        >
        (derived from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía) 'inquiry; knowledge
        acquired by investigation') is the systematic study and documentation of
        the human past. History is an academic discipline which uses a narrative
        to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate
        their patterns of cause and effect. Historians debate which narrative
        best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes
        and effects. Historians debate the nature of history as an end in
        itself, and its usefulness in giving perspective on the problems of the
        present.

      <li>Writing</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing" target="_blank"
          >Writing</a
        >
        is the act of creating a persistent representation of human language. A
        writing system uses a set of symbols and rules to encode aspects of
        spoken language, such as its lexicon and syntax. However, written
        language may take on characteristics distinct from those of any spoken
        language.

      <li>Abstrat Reasoning</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction" target="_blank"
          >Abstact Reasoning</a
        >
        is the ability to think about concepts and ideas that aren't physically
        present, and to solve problems using that information. It involves:
        Recognizing patterns, Making connections, Understanding complex
        relationships, and Formulating theories about objects and ideas.

      <li>Japanese</li>

          target="_blank"
          >Japanese</a
        >
        (日本語, Nihongo, [ɲihoŋɡo] ⓘ) is the principal language of the Japonic
        language family spoken by the Japanese people. It has around 123 million
        speakers, primarily in Japan, the only country where it is the national
        language, and within the Japanese diaspora worldwide.

      <li>Reading Comprehension</li>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension"
          target="_blank"
          >Reading Comprehenison</a
        >
        is the ability to process written text, understand its meaning, and to
        integrate with what the reader already knows. Reading comprehension
        relies on two abilities that are connected to each other: word reading
        and language comprehension. Comprehension specifically is a "creative,
        multifaceted process" that is dependent upon four language skills:
        phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

      <li>Music</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music" target="_blank">Music</a> is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form,
        harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content Music
        is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all
        human societies. Definitions of music vary widely in substance and
        approach. While scholars agree that music is defined by a small
        number of specific elements, there is no consensus as to what these
        necessary elements are. Music is often characterized as a highly
        versatile medium for expressing human creativity. Diverse activities
        are involved in the creation of music, and are often divided into
        categories of composition, improvisation, and performance. Music may
        be performed using a wide variety of musical instruments, including the
        human voice. It can also be composed, sequenced, or otherwise produced
        to be indirectly played mechanically or electronically, such as via a
        music box, barrel organ, or digital audio workstation software on a
        computer.
