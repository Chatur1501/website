    <h2>India</h2>

    <p>
      India, officially the Republic of India,is a country in South Asia. It is
      the seventh-largest country in the world by area and the most populous
      country. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the
      southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders
      with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
      Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the
      vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands
      share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

    <h2>Japan</h2>

    <p>
      Japan is an island country in East Asia. It is located in the Pacific
      Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland, and is bordered on
      the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the
      north to the East China Sea in the south. The Japanese archipelago
      consists of four major islands—Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu—and
      thousands of smaller islands, covering 377,975 square kilometres (145,937
      sq mi). Japan has a population of nearly 124 million as of 2024, and is
      the eleventh-most populous country. Its capital and largest city is Tokyo;
      the Greater Tokyo Area is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with
      more than 38 million inhabitants as of 2016. Japan is divided into 47
      administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. About
      three-quarters of the country's terrain is mountainous and heavily
      forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population
      along its eastern coastal plains. The country sits on the Pacific Ring of
      Fire, making its islands prone to destructive earthquakes and tsunamis.

    <h2>Thailand</h2>
    <img src="images/thailand.jpeg" alt="thailand">
    <p>
      Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand and historically known as
      Siam (the official name until 1939), is a country in Southeast Asia on the
      Indochinese Peninsula. With a population of almost 66 million, it spans
      513,115 square kilometres (198,115 sq mi). Thailand is bordered to the
      northwest by Myanmar, to the northeast and east by Laos, to the southeast
      by Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the
      southwest by the Andaman Sea; it also shares maritime borders with Vietnam
      to the southeast and Indonesia and India to the southwest. Bangkok is the
      state capital and largest city.

    <h2>New Zealand</h2>

    <p>
      Early Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line
      with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment,
      eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation
      was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes
      (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the
      community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of
      their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture,
      particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still
      regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their
      identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian
      peoples. More recently, American, Australian, Asian and other European
      cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian
      cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian
      festival, now an annual event in Auckland.

    <h2>USA</h2>
    <img src="images/usa.jpeg" alt="usa">
    <p>
      The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States
      (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It is
      a federal union of 50 states and a federal capital district, Washington,
      D.C. The 48 contiguous states border Canada to the north and Mexico to the
      south, with the states of Alaska to the northwest and the archipelagic
      Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The United States also asserts sovereignty
      over five major island territories and various uninhabited islands.[j] The
      country has the world's third-largest land area,[d] largest exclusive
      economic zone, and third-largest population, exceeding 334 million.[k] Its
      three largest metropolitan areas are New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago,
      and its three most populous states are California, Texas, and Florida.
