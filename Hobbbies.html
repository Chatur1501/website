      <p>
        Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a
        single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each
        (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike
        a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the
        opponent's court. The object is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that
        the opponent is not able to play a valid return. If a player is unable
        to return the ball successfully, the opponent scores a point.

        Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods,
        theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of
        empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of
        mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra
        (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of
        shapes and spaces tht contain them), analysis (the study of continuous
        changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all
        mathematics).

      <p>
        Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information
        and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares
        arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. The players, referred to generically as "White"
        and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two
        rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first,
        followed by Black; then moves alternate. The object of the game is to
        checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are
        also several ways a game can end in a draw.

      <p>
        Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form,
        harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. Music is
        generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all human
        societies. Definitions of music vary widely in substance and approach.
        While scholars agree that music is defined by a small number of specific
        elements, there is no consensus as to what these necessary elements are.
        Music is often characterized as a highly versatile medium for expressing
        human creativity. Diverse activities are involved in the creation of
        music, and are often divided into categories of composition,
        improvisation, and performance. Music may be performed using a wide
        variety of musical instruments, including the human voice. It can also
        be composed, sequenced, or otherwise produced to be indirectly played
        mechanically or electronically, such as via a music box, barrel organ,
        or digital audio workstation software on a computer.

      <p>
        Science is a systematic discipline that builds and organises knowledge
        in the form of testable hypotheses and predictions about the
        universe. Modern science is typically divided into two or three
        major branches: the natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and
        biology), which study the physical world; and the behavioural sciences
        (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals
        and societies. The formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and
        theoretical computer science), which study formal systems governed by
        axioms and rules, are sometimes described as being sciences as
        well; however, they are often regarded as a separate field because they
        rely on deductive reasoning instead of the scientific method or
        empirical evidence as their main methodology. Applied sciences are
        disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such
        as engineering and medicine.
